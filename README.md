# 🌱 Sprout Web App

**Scan. Grow. Battle.** — the web platform for Sprout (50.003 ESC, Cohort 3 Team 2): auth, Pokédex-style plant avatar archive, GenAI sprite pipeline, PVE battles, a public almanac of 200 Singapore flowering plants, an admin dashboard (API health, Firestore cleanup, discoveries), and a contact/query-ticket system. **Stack: TypeScript everywhere** — React + Vite (frontend) and Node.js + Express (backend), with **Cloud Firestore** as the database (Firebase Auth for login).

> 👉 **Building the frontend? Read [`md/FRONTEND_HANDOFF.md`](md/FRONTEND_HANDOFF.md) first** — it's the fast path: run the backend, call the API, done.

This README assumes **zero prior setup** — follow it top to bottom and you'll have the backend running locally in ~10 minutes. If something breaks, check [Common problems](#common-problems) before pinging the chat.

> **Deploying or explaining hosting? Read [`md/DEPLOYMENT.md`](md/DEPLOYMENT.md)** for the simple Vercel + Render setup, env vars, CORS, and demo auth bypass.

**Read `md/SPECS.md` first.** It explains which document wins when they disagree and the rules for working in parallel without stepping on each other.

**Everything is TypeScript.** The backend runs directly from `.ts` files via `tsx` (no build step in dev); tests use `ts-jest`. `npm run typecheck` in `server/` checks types without running.

## 1. Prerequisites (one-time)

| Tool | Check if you have it | If not |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js 22 LTS** | run `node --version` in a terminal | install the LTS from https://nodejs.org |
| **Git** | `git --version` | https://git-scm.com/downloads |
| A terminal | PowerShell (Windows) / Terminal (Mac) | built-in |
| **Postman** *(optional)* | — | https://www.postman.com/downloads — nice GUI for testing APIs |

> **Windows note:** if `node` isn't recognised after installing, close and reopen your terminal.

## 2. First-time local setup

Follow this when you clone the repo for the first time.

### Step 1: Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kopi-O-Kosong-Beng/sprout-web-app.git
cd sprout-web-app
npm install
```

This installs dependencies for both workspaces:

```text
client/
server/
```

### Step 2: Create backend env file

Copy the root example env into `server/.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example server/.env
```

Windows option: copy `.env.example` in File Explorer, paste it inside
`server/`, then rename it to `.env`.

Firestore is the only application datastore. For local backend development,
get `serviceAccountKey.json` privately from Zhi Feng, place it in `server/`, and
set `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=./serviceAccountKey.json`. Automated tests
need no key: they use the isolated `sprout-test` Firestore Emulator on
`127.0.0.1:8080`.

For local frontend work before Firebase login is implemented, keep this in
`server/.env`:

```text
AUTH_DEV_BYPASS=true
```

That lets local requests use:

```text
x-dev-uid: demo-user-0001
```

If Firestore is empty, seed it with:

```bash
npm run seed:firestore -w server
```

To make the auth test panel login as the seeded avatar owner, also run:

```bash
npm run seed:firebase-auth-demo -w server
```

Demo login:

```text
email: demo@sprout.app
password: Password123!
```

To create the admin login that opens the `/admin` account dashboard:

```bash
npm run seed:admin -w server
```

It reads `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `server/.env`, or takes
them as arguments (`-- sprout@gmail.com 'the-password'`). The account is created
with its email already verified, so no verification link has to be collected
from a shared inbox. Re-running it is safe and is also how you reset a forgotten
admin password: the uid, PVE stats and history survive.

Creating the account is not what grants access — the address must also be in
`SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS` in `server/.env`, the operator allowlist that gates
`/api/admin` and `/api/platform` (`ADMIN_EMAILS` is an advisory badge only).
The allowlist is the only authority (it fails closed when empty), and the seed
warns if the address is missing from it. Restart the backend after editing it.

**Where login lands.** Everyone enters at `/`, the public landing page. After a
successful login a super admin goes to `/admin` and everyone else goes to
`/home`, the in-game hub — unless a protected route bounced them, in which case
they return to the page they originally asked for. The frontend reads this from
the `isSuperAdmin` field on `GET /api/auth/me`, which the server computes from
`SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS`; it decides navigation only, and `/api/admin` re-checks
the allowlist on every request.

### Step 3: Create frontend env file

Copy the frontend example env:

```bash
cp client/.env.example client/.env.local
```

Windows option: copy `client/.env.example`, paste it in `client/`, then rename
the copy to `.env.local`.

For local development, `client/.env.local` should contain:

```text
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=<from Firebase web app config>
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=<from Firebase web app config>
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=<from Firebase web app config>
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=<from Firebase web app config>
```

`VITE_API_URL` tells the Vite frontend where the local backend is running. The
`VITE_FIREBASE_*` values are the Firebase **web app config**, not the secret
service account. They are safe for frontend code and are needed for the auth
test panel.

### Step 4: Start the backend

In terminal 1:

```bash
npm run dev:server
```

You should see:

```text
Sprout backend listening on http://localhost:3001 (Firestore)
Health check: http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

Verify backend:

```text
http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

Expected:

```json
{ "status": "ok", "timestamp": "..." }
```

### Step 5: Start the frontend

In terminal 2:

```bash
npm run dev:client
```

Vite should print a local URL, usually:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

Open that URL in the browser.

### Step 6: Quick local checks

Backend health should work:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

Query submit should return a ticket reference:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/query/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"name\":\"Local Smoke\",\"email\":\"local@example.com\",\"category\":\"general\",\"message\":\"Local setup test\"}"
```

Avatar demo data should work while `AUTH_DEV_BYPASS=true`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/avatar -H "x-dev-uid: demo-user-0001"
```

See the database anytime:

```bash
npm run inspect:firestore -w server
```

### Signing in locally without a password

You do not need a real Firebase account to click through the app. On the login
page, enter:

```
email:     test@sprout.com
password:  anything at all — it is not read
```

That takes a local-only shortcut: no Firebase call, no ID token. The client
stores a "dev session" and sends `x-dev-uid` / `x-dev-email` headers, which the
backend's `AUTH_DEV_BYPASS` already understands. You land as an **operator**,
so `/admin`, `/studio` and `/test` are reachable too.

Two things have to be true for it to work, and both are already set by
[Step 2](#step-2-create-backend-env-file):

```
AUTH_DEV_BYPASS=true
SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS=...,test@sprout.com    # the address must be on the operator allowlist
```

The operator part is not special-cased — the server derives `isSuperAdmin`
from that email through the normal allowlist, so if you take `test@sprout.com`
out of `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS` you still sign in, just as an ordinary player.
Handy for checking what a non-operator sees. "Log out" clears the session as
usual.

> **This cannot activate on a deployment.** The client half goes through
> `import.meta.env.DEV`, which compiles to a literal `false` in `vite build`
> (it minifies to `function(){return!1}`), so the dev session is always `null`
> and the headers are never sent. The server half independently requires
> `AUTH_DEV_BYPASS=true` **and** `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`, and `render.yaml`
> pins `AUTH_DEV_BYPASS=false`. Neither half alone opens anything: a deployed
> API refuses these headers even from a locally-run client, and a deployed
> client never sends them even against a local API.
>
> Note the shortcut is inert in the production bundle, not stripped from it —
> `test@sprout.com` and `sprout-dev-session` are readable in the shipped JS.
> Nothing relies on them being secret. Still, do not add `test@sprout.com` to
> `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS` (or `ADMIN_EMAILS`) on a deployed environment: that
> would make it a live operator address the moment anyone creates that
> Firebase account for real.

To act as a specific user instead — a different archive, say — set the dev
session yourself in the browser console:

```js
localStorage.setItem('sprout-dev-session',
  JSON.stringify({ uid: 'demo-user-0001', email: 'test@sprout.com' }))
```

### The almanac taxonomy

The landing page and the admin dashboard share a fixed list of 200 Singapore
flowering plants, in `server/data/almanac-taxonomy.json`. It is derived from:

> Chong, K. Y., Tan, H. T. W. & Corlett, R. T. (2009). *A Checklist of the Total
> Vascular Plant Flora of Singapore: Native, Naturalised and Cultivated
> Species.* Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research, NUS.

`scripts/extract-flora-checklist.py` builds the file from that PDF and documents
the selection rules — only species the checklist itself calls common,
naturalised or casual; flowering plants only; families drawn round-robin so no
one family dominates. Species, family, status, origin and growth form all come
from the source. **Common names do not** — the checklist has none, so they are
hand-added in the script for the 68 species whose name is well established here,
and left null for the rest.

### Plant art

The five demo plants use hand-made art in `client/public/plants/` — a
`SPRITE_<Name>.png` creature and the `IMG_<Name>.jpg` photo it was drawn from,
which the archive shows on the specimen card. The exact filenames are listed in
the README there and named in `server/data/demo-avatar-templates.ts`, alongside
each plant's stats.

Thornback, the battle opponent, is rendered by the pipeline instead. Run this
once and commit the PNG so every deploy serves the same opponent:

```bash
npm run sprites:generate -w server                     # anything still missing
npm run sprites:generate -w server -- --force          # re-render everything
npm run sprites:generate -w server -- --only=thornback # just one
```

This needs an image-model key in `server/.env` — `FLUX_API_KEY` (or
`NVIDIA_API_KEY`) and/or `GEMINI_API_KEY`, ideally with `REMOVE_BG_API_KEY` for
a transparent cutout. Without one the script stops rather than commit the
pipeline's placeholder drawing. Missing sprites are not fatal: an avatar with no
sprite file renders as an empty pot.

## 3. Try the API

**Easiest:** open `test.html` in this repo with VS Code's *Live Server* extension (right-click → "Open with Live Server"). It's a real form that submits a query ticket to your local backend and shows the response.

**Or with Postman / curl:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/query/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Your Name","email":"you@example.com","category":"general","message":"hello"}'
```

→ returns `201 {"refNumber":"SPR-20260712-0001"}` and the row is now in the database.

**Seeded demo data:** user `demo@sprout.app` (id `demo-user-0001`) with 5 plant avatars, ready for the avatar-archive endpoints. Reseed with `npm run seed`.

**Try a protected endpoint** (avatar archive) — during dev you can stand in for the demo user with one header, no login needed:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/avatar -H "x-dev-uid: demo-user-0001"
```

→ returns the 5 seeded avatars. (This dev shortcut needs `AUTH_DEV_BYPASS=true` in `server/.env`; it's off in production. See [`md/FRONTEND_HANDOFF.md`](md/FRONTEND_HANDOFF.md) §3.)

**Run the tests:** `npm test`. Backend integration tests run against the local
`sprout-test` Firestore Emulator and never your live Firebase project.

## 4. Current API (more coming — check back)

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/health` | — | liveness ping |
| POST | `/api/auth/signup` | — | create Firebase Auth user + profile |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | Bearer token | current authenticated profile |
| POST | `/api/auth/request-reset` | — | send 6-digit OTP via email log/SMTP |
| POST | `/api/auth/verify-reset` | — | verify OTP and update password |
| POST | `/api/query/submit` | — | create query ticket → `{refNumber}` |
| GET | `/api/avatar` | Bearer token | list caller's avatars (paginated) |
| GET | `/api/avatar/:id` | Bearer token | one avatar (ownership-checked) |
| POST | `/api/avatar` | Bearer token | save a scanned plant into the archive |
| GET | `/api/almanac` | **—** | the 200-species almanac: found / not found + tallies |
| GET | `/api/almanac/:speciesId` | optional | one species; a login adds the finder, date and photo |
| POST | `/api/battle/pve/start` | Bearer token | start a PVE battle with one of your avatars |
| GET/POST | `/api/battle/pve/:sessionId`(`/action`, `/abandon`) | Bearer token | read a session, take a turn, concede |
| POST | `/api/pipeline/run-stream` | Bearer token | the 4-hop sprite pipeline, streamed as SSE |
| GET | `/api/admin/users`, `/api/admin/almanac` | Bearer + `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS` | accounts; taxonomy with finders |
| POST | `/api/admin/cleanup` | Bearer + `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS` | dry-run / delete expired web uploads |
| GET | `/api/platform/*` | Bearer + `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS` | pipeline portal: config, live provider health, tests |

Two of these are deliberately unlike the rest. `GET /api/almanac` takes no auth
at all — it is the landing page's centrepiece and is shown to visitors who have
never signed up, so it carries the taxonomy and a found/not-found flag and
nothing a player contributed. `GET /api/almanac/:speciesId` takes *optional*
auth: anyone may see a species, the sprite the game made of it and its battle
stats, while the finder's display name, the discovery date and their own
photograph need a login. That split is the privacy model, and
[`md/FRONTEND_HANDOFF.md`](md/FRONTEND_HANDOFF.md) documents the exact shapes.

The **exact** request/response contracts (status codes, error strings, limits like "5 MB", "10 attempts / 15 min") live in `md/requirements.md` — the tests assert those exact values, so code against the doc, not from memory. Frontend integration details: [`md/FRONTEND_HANDOFF.md`](md/FRONTEND_HANDOFF.md).

## 5. The database story (IMPORTANT — read once)

The database is Cloud Firestore, shared with the Sprout mobile app. Runtime code
always uses the Firebase Admin repositories in `server/repositories/`; services
and controllers depend on repository interfaces instead of Firebase Admin
directly. Local automated tests use the Firebase Emulator. Full setup steps:
[`server/FIREBASE_SETUP.md`](server/FIREBASE_SETUP.md).

**Auth (for frontend work):** users sign in with the **Firebase JS SDK** in the React app, grab the ID token, and send it as `Authorization: Bearer <idToken>` on every protected API call. The current demo flow uses email/password; other Firebase sign-in providers can be added later without changing the backend token-verification pattern.

## Production auth, email, and storage

Render declares SMTP delivery but does not store credentials in `render.yaml`. For `hello.sprout.team@gmail.com`, enable Google 2-Step Verification, create a Google Account -> Security -> App passwords entry named `Sprout Backend`, and place the resulting 16-character app password only in local `server/.env` (`SMTP_PASS`) and Render's secret environment dashboard. With it configured, run `npm.cmd run check:email -w server`; a live SMTP preflight is successful only when it prints `[email-check] mode=smtp verified=true`.

Before deployment, add the Vercel domain in Firebase Console -> Authentication -> Settings -> Authorized domains and set Render `FRONTEND_URL` to that HTTPS origin. Verification links must point to `https://<vercel-domain>/verify-email?...`, and the page must successfully apply the Firebase action code. Firebase remains the authority for identity: the client sends Firebase ID tokens and the backend verifies them.

Firebase Storage is active at `sprout-dev-66f08.firebasestorage.app`. The live Node 22 Admin preflight passed write, exact read-back, and deletion on 2026-07-21. This proves backend credential/bucket access only; Admin SDK requests bypass client Security Rules. Direct client rules and the application Storage adapter remain untested, so Render stays pinned to `STORAGE_MODE=local`. The detailed status and procedure are in [`server/FIREBASE_SETUP.md`](server/FIREBASE_SETUP.md).

## 6. Backend layout (where to put things)

```
server/
├── app.ts              ← Express wiring (CORS, rate limit, routers, error handler)
├── server.ts           ← Firestore-backed entry point listening on :3001
├── routes/             ← URL definitions + validation schemas
├── controllers/        ← request/response handling, no business logic
├── services/           ← business logic (ticket refs, emails, battle math…)
├── repositories/       ← Firebase Admin persistence adapters
├── models/             ← TypeScript domain types + repository interfaces
├── middleware/         ← auth (Firebase ID tokens), validation, errors
├── data/               ← deterministic demo avatar templates
├── scripts/            ← Firestore seeds, inspection, and preflight utilities
├── firebase.ts         ← Firebase Admin SDK init (lazy)
└── tests/              ← Jest + Supertest (ts-jest)
```

Rule of thumb: routes stay thin → controllers translate HTTP → services do the thinking → repositories do the storing.

## 7. Team workflow

1. Claim your task in `md/tasks.md` (suggested owners are at the top) — put your name
2. Branch: `git checkout -b feat/task-<n>-<slug>` (e.g. `feat/task-14-avatar-archive-ui`)
3. Code against `md/requirements.md`; mock external APIs (`USE_MOCK_APIS=true` — never call real plant.id/Gemma/FLUX in dev)
4. Done = happy path + error paths work, your module's tests pass, `npm run dev` still boots
5. Push your branch → open a Pull Request on GitHub → someone else eyeballs it → merge
6. `git pull` main regularly so integration stays boring

## Common problems

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `EADDRINUSE :::3001` on start | Something else is on port 3001. Either stop it, or run with another port: `PORT=3002 npm run dev` (PowerShell: `$env:PORT=3002; npm run dev`) — remember your frontend/test.html then needs the new port |
| `'node' is not recognized` | Install Node LTS, then **reopen** the terminal |
| `Cannot find module ...` | You skipped `npm install`, or you're in the wrong folder — run it from the repo root |
| Startup error mentioning Firebase / credentials | Configure one Firebase Admin credential method from `.env.example`; automated tests use the emulator and need no key |
| `The query requires an index` from Firestore | shouldn't happen with current code (we sort in-memory); if a new query hits it, click the link in the error to create the index, or sort in the app |
| `401 Unauthorised` on `/api/avatar` | preferred: login in the auth test panel and send the Firebase ID token. Fallback: send `x-dev-uid: demo-user-0001` in dev with `AUTH_DEV_BYPASS=true` |
| test.html says "Backend not reachable" | Backend isn't running (`npm run dev`), or it's on a different port |
| "Failed to fetch" in browser but Postman works | CORS — dev server allows origins `:5173` and `:5500` only; serve your page from one of those (Vite / Live Server) |
| `.env` questions | Never commit `server/.env` or `serviceAccountKey.json`. They're gitignored on purpose. `.env.example` shows what keys exist |

Still stuck? Share only the minimal relevant, sanitized error lines. Redact tokens, OTPs, email addresses, environment values, local paths, and service-account details before posting anything to the group chat.

Both were migrated into this repo (`server/pipeline/`, `server/platform/`, `client/src/studio/`) rather than kept as a third app, and changes made there since are ported across periodically. The two copies are intentionally not identical: this one keeps its verified-login + `ADMIN_EMAILS` gate on the portal, accepts either spelling of each provider key, and adapts a handful of lines to this repo's stricter tsconfig.
