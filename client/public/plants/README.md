# Demo plant art

Art for the five demo plants, served by the client at `/plants/`. Each plant
is a pair: the sprite that stands in the pot on the shelf, and the photograph
it was drawn from, which the archive shows on the specimen card.

The committed sprites are pipeline renders — hand-made art never landed here,
which left every seeded avatar 404ing to a bare pot. Until someone draws them
by hand, regenerate them with:

```
npm run sprites:generate:demo -w server            # anything still missing
npm run sprites:generate:demo -w server -- --force # re-render
```

Dropping in a hand-drawn `SPRITE_<Key>.png` simply replaces the render; the
generator skips files that already exist unless `--force` is passed.

| Plant | Sprite | Photo |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Helianthus annuus (sunflower) | `SPRITE_Helianthus.png` | `IMG_Helianthus.jpg` |
| Quercus robur (English oak) | `SPRITE_Quercus.png` | `IMG_Quercus.jpg` |
| Monstera deliciosa (swiss cheese plant) | `SPRITE_Monstera.png` | `IMG_Monstera.jpg` |
| Ficus lyrata (fiddle-leaf fig) | `SPRITE_Ficus.png` | `IMG_Ficus.jpg` |
| Amanita muscaria (fly agaric) | `SPRITE_Amanita.png` | `IMG_Amanita.jpg` |

The filenames are matched exactly, not guessed at. If a file you add uses a
different extension — or you swap in a different species for one of the five —
edit that template's `spriteFile` / `photoFile` in
`server/data/demo-avatar-templates.ts`, which is the only place they are named.

Sprites should be PNG with a transparent background so the pot shows through
behind the feet; 192×192 matches what the scan pipeline produces, and the
archive scales whatever it gets. A missing file is not fatal: the plant renders
as an empty pot, and the specimen card simply omits the photo.

The stats, species and habitat text for each plant live beside the filenames in
`demo-avatar-templates.ts` — art here, numbers there.

Thornback, the battle opponent, is not hand-made: it is rendered by
`npm run sprites:generate -w server` into `client/public/sprites/`.
